======================================================================================================
MEMO about possible values of iConve:
0 = lower mantle is static (with respect to AF)
1 = Hager and O'Connell (1979) minimum-flow kinematic Model II
2 = Baumgardner (1988) dynamic model of Figure 7A-F, * 10. because Ra was too low
3 = PB2002 (Bird, 2003) (i.e., lower mantle flow is identical to surface velocities)
4 = PB2002 flow which drags continents; but NO drag on oceanic lithosphere
5 = drag on base of subduction forearc only (for local models)
6 = sense & traction from traction pole vector for each plate (use vTimes = 1.0)

It is important within the parameter file that lines with multiple inputs seperated by a comma must not have a space before
or after the comma (e.g. 5.E8,5.E8  not  5.E8, 5.E8).
